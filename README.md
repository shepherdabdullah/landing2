# landing2
Landing Page Project Example 2 is inspired by my love for mixed martial arts
and combat sports as a whole. It is a parody on fake martial arts gurus and
other instructors who spread nonsensical information and pass it off as
martial arts techniques. This project serves to be the homepage of a Muay
Thai gym that teachs a secret highly coveted striking style known as "The
Bullshido Method". It gives a small amount of generic information to replicate
that of a small business landingpage.
